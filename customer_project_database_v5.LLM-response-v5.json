Specifically, nine code strings were missing from the TB7020.TXT file, and new schedules were added to the UT NAM Job, which contributed to these delays., Rectification Measures: Actions taken included assigning a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to Prashant Gajar and Mihir M., with a planned completion date. GCS data verification was also performed prior to starting the monthly data load activity. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains uncertain given the prior recurrence of the issues., Client Satisfaction: Client feedback indicates dissatisfaction, particularly from Kershnee, who expressed concerns over the repeated nature of the issues and the pressure it places on their team. The unresolved issues have led to frustration., Major Challenges: The major challenges faced include data quality issues, changes in job scheduling, and a lack of timely communication regarding these changes. Additionally, there was a failure to adequately verify data before processing., Communication Issues: There were notable communication problems regarding the changes in job scheduling and the data verification process.
